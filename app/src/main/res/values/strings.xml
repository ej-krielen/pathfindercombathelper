    <string name="condition_grappled_message">
        Grappled creatures cannot move and take a –4 penalty to Dexterity, a –2 penalty on all attack rolls and combat maneuver checks, except those made to grapple or escape a grapple.
        \nA grappled creatures can take no action that requires two hands to perform, and they cannot make attacks of opportunity.
        \n \nCasting Spells while Grappled/Grappling: \nThe only spells which can be cast while grappling or pinned are those without somatic components and whose material components (if any) you have in hand.
        \nEven so, you must make a concentration check (DC 10 + the grappler\'s CMB + the level of the spell you\'re casting) or lose the spell.
        \n \nA grappled creature cannot use Stealth to hide from the creature grappling it, even if a special ability, such as hide in plain sight, would normally allow it to do so.
        \nIf a grappled creature becomes invisible, through a spell or other ability, it gains a +2 circumstance bonus on its CMD to avoid being grappled, but receives no other benefit.

    <string name="grapple_note_grab">Grab can be used after a natural attack as a free action, does not provoke and gets a +4 bonus. Read more.</string>
    <string name="grapple_dialog_grab_title">Special attack: Grab (Ex)</string>
    <string name="grapple_dialog_grab_message">If a creature with this special attack hits with the indicated attack (usually a claw or bite attack), it deals normal damage and attempts to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity.
        Unless otherwise noted, grab can only be used against targets of a size equal to or smaller than the creature with this ability. If the creature can use grab on creatures of other sizes, it is noted in the creature\'s Special Attacks line.
        The creature has the option to conduct the grapple normally, or simply use the part of its body it used in the grab to hold the opponent. If it chooses to do the latter, it takes a –20 penalty on its CMB check to make and maintain the grapple,
        but does not gain the grappled condition itself. A successful hold does not deal any extra damage unless the creature also has the constrict special attack. If the creature does not constrict,
        each successful grapple check it makes during successive rounds automatically deals the damage indicated for the attack that established the hold. Otherwise, it deals constriction damage as well (the amount is given in the creature’s descriptive text).
        \n \nCreatures with the grab special attack receive a +4 bonus on combat maneuver checks made to start and maintain a grapple.</string>
